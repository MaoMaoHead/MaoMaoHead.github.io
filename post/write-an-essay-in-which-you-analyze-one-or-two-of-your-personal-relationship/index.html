<h3 id="dear-tom">Dear Tom,</h3>
<p>How's it going? I am more than glad to share something about how body language is used in my culture with you. And I do hope what I write below will enhance your understanding of me and my culture.</p>
<p>As the old saying goes, &quot;Action speaks louder than words&quot;. The same goes for the body language, though its original meaning doesn't point to it. It goes without saying that different cultures display some commonalities but also exhibit significant differences in almost every aspect, including body languages. To begin with, similarities exist in how they use body languages between your culture and my culture. Take smiling as an example, which conveys honesty and friendliness in both my culture and yours. Whereas, there are body languages which are unique in my culture besides the common ones. Manifesting in the usage of body languages, one of the most distinguishing characteristics of my culture is that people in my culture prefer to be veiled. Among various kinds of body language, touching is seen as one kind of negative body language, which may be used to express friendliness in your country. Touching one's temples is one good example, having the meaning that there is something wrong with the touched person's mind, which may be regarded as a positive action praising the cleverness of the person who is touched in your country. In addition to this, we also keep a proper distance with each other and avoid touching in a bit to show politeness and respect, except the one who you're close with. What's more, I'd like to stress that the way we use body languages is shifting day by day, especially after reform and opening up. A mounting number of usages of body language from all around the world are accepted by Chinese people as we integrate into the world. At the same time, the native usages keep updating with the development of the era. How my culture uses body languages should not be viewed in a fixed way.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, there are similarities and differences between your culture and mine when it comes to the usage of body language. But for all that, it pays to get acquainted with them, so that we can understand each other better. So I'm looking forward to sharing more about your culture and hearing about your experiences as well. Best wishes!</p>
