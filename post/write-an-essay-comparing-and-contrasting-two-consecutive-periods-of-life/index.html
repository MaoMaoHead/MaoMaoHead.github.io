<p>Adolescence and adulthood are two closely related but terribly different periods of human development. Legally, adolescence typically refers to the period of aging between 10 and 18, while adulthood is known as the state of aging more than 18. Nevertheless, there are more differences between the two periods than ages.<br>
To start with, the body of one adult differs from that of one adolescent. The body becomes higher and stronger, accompanied by the maturity of secondary sex characters. What's more, it cannot be ignored that adults are more independent in comparison with adolescents. When one shifts from adolescence to adulthood, he gains more ability to live, think and make decisions on his own, and gradually becomes less and less independent on his parents. He will try to cope with the problem with nothing but his effort, rather than seeking assistance from others. Last but not least, taking on more responsibilities is the most significant matter for an adult, while adolescents sometimes still have the right to shirk some certain obligations. For one thing, adults are expected to make contributions to family, society and the country, from which adolescents are free. For another thing, adolescents often are given a lighter punishment than adults when they make mistakes.<br>
In a nutshell, much difference exists between adolescence and adulthood. However, it is worth emphasizing that the two periods of human life are closely related. We need to cherish the current stage of our life, whether we are adults or just adolescents.<br>
